This week I am preparing for the Progress Meeting. I have built a simple front-end interface and database for my program, and completed a simple prototype for presentation. In addition I wrote some routes for interacting with the game library system, where users can buy, sell and manage games. . The /checkout route handles the user's cart items, adding them to the user's library and clearing the cart. The route /library displays the user's game library and wallet balance; the /sell_game route allows the user to sell games from their library, thus updating their wallet balance accordingly. The necessary functions of the backend are basically developed. Next week I will focus on debugging. For example, adding a free game to the shopping cart cannot be checked out. There is also the need to replace the front end and database.
